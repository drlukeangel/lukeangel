title: "Building IoT Connected Products v2"
summary: "The PRD for v2 was a list of v1's mistakes, inverted. Wireless: don't pick the protocol before you know the duty cycle. Identity: per-device cert from boot zero, not bolted on at scale. OTA: signed, staged, rollback-able, or don't ship. Building the same kind of platform a second time — on purpose."

The first time I built a connected-product platform — [v1, in medical hardware](/notebooks/building-medical-iot-connected-products/) — every PRD section had a hidden cost we paid for later. Wireless protocol picked before the duty cycle was understood. Identity scoped to the fleet, not the device. OTA shipped without rollback. None of it was *wrong* — it was what we knew at the time.

The second time — on purpose, with the v1 receipts in hand — I started by writing those costs down and inverting them. The v2 PRD opens with a wireless rubric (BLE vs LoRa vs cellular, decided up front), per-device identity from boot zero, OTA signed and staged. Every section traces back to a specific moment in v1 when the architecture cost us a sprint or a customer.

What follows is what happened when the v2 PRD met reality — what survived the trip from blueprint to fleet, and what didn't.
